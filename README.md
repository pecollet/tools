## Cluster control
### Local cluster
Deploys a cluster with several processes on the local machine by offsetting port numbers
  * deployment : `cluster_build_v3_mac.sh` (Dana's script with extras)
  * start/stop : Calls `bin/neo4f $1` on each instance. Generated by deployment script for the version installed. ex: `startStopCluster-3.5.12.sh`
  * edit config : Adds a key=value in the neo4j.conf of each instance. Generated by deployment script for the version installed. ex: `addClusterConfig-3.5.12.sh`
### Ansible playbooks for AWS 
starts a number of EC2 VMs, installs and starts a Neo4j cluster on them.
  * pre-reqs : 
    * ansible installed locally
    * export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your key>
    * export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your key secret>
  * set parameters in variables.yml
    * standard EC2 VM params
    * ec2_cluster_id : used to identify VMs in cluster, so make that unique (so they can be found when inventory-ing them, terminating them)
    * Software versions : make sure java verison is compatible with neo version
  * run `deploy.sh` to start the Neo4j cluster
  * `ansible-playbook ec2_stop_playbook.yml` to remove it
